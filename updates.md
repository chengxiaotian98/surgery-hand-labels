# Updates and Changes  

## Test 7/16/19 and things to do    

[x] 1. On `REAMDE.md`, change `cd surgery-labels` to `cd surgery-hand-labels`  
[x] 2. Specify to take images out of the downloaded folder (or at least load the necessary ones in)  
[ ] 3. If skipped or messed up an image, make it possible to go back, also include the image id (people can write this down)  
[x] 4. Specify right or left hand before - Could be the same implementation as the bounding box.  
[x] 5. Note that for npm start, need to run this from the directory. Do this in a seperate window than the terminal command to start the server.  
[x] 6. For the error with global, don't have profile, just do the PATH command only.  
[x] 7. Left align the header information  
[x] 8. Header information should just be in form "hand:'    '" in a list probably.  
[ ] 9. Look into being able to make overlapping points, also playing around with smaller circles, no label,  
[x] 10. For single keypoint, make so that if you click, you replace the keypoint (when in that keypoint mode)  
[x] 11. Specify tested on Macs  
[ ] 12. For checking, if there is the error 'undefined has no property keypoints', make this fine - or check that the array length is greater than 0.    
[x] 13. Add action for no hands, as opposed to skipping an image?
