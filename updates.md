# Updates and Changes  

## Test 7/16/19 and things to do    

1. [x] On `REAMDE.md`, change `cd surgery-labels` to `cd surgery-hand-labels`  
2. [x] Specify to take images out of the downloaded folder (or at least load the necessary ones in)  
3. [x] If skipped or messed up an image, make it possible to go back, also include the image id (people can write this down) - _included image id_  
4. [x] Specify right or left hand before - Could be the same implementation as the bounding box.  
5. [x] Note that for npm start, need to run this from the directory. Do this in a seperate window than the terminal command to start the server.  
6. [x] For the error with global, don't have profile, just do the PATH command only.  
7. [x] Left align the header information  
8. [x] Header information should just be in form "hand:'    '" in a list probably.  
9. [x] Look into being able to make overlapping points, also playing around with smaller circles, no label  
10. [x] For single keypoint, make so that if you click, you replace the keypoint (when in that keypoint mode)  
11. [x] Specify tested on Macs  
12. [ ] For checking, if there is the error 'undefined has no property keypoints', make this fine - or check that the array length is greater than 0.    
13. [x] Add action for no hands, as opposed to skipping an image?   
14. [x] Bounding box renders in keypoint mode
